#### Martingale Levels (Level 2-8)

- **Sell Orders**: Opens when price rises above last sell order by the specified Entry Distance
- **Trend Protection**: Optionally requires price to show reversal signs before opening
- **MACD Protection**: Optionally blocks entries during strong adverse MACD trends

### Exit Logic
- **Trailing Stop**: Activates when profit exceeds Trailing Points threshold
- **Stop Loss Trail**: Follows price at Stop Trailing Points distance
- **All Positions**: Closes when trailing stop is hit
